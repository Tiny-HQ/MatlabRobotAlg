# Robot Algorithms: Insights and Thoughts

This repository contains a collection of robot algorithms I have written over the years. It aims to provide beginners with some guidance and offer experienced algorithm developers ideas for tackling challenging problems. The content primarily covers current research directions for robotic arms, including **kinematics**, **dynamics**, **statics**, **trajectory planning**, and more. All the algorithms have been verified through my personal tests. However, there may still be edge cases or issues that haven't been fully considered, so this is shared for reference. Feedback is welcome, and I’m happy to explore new ideas and continuously improve the repository.

My approach is to incorporate excellent articles and algorithms I come across into this collection. Experienced contributors are also encouraged to add algorithms for unexplored areas, such as AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) algorithms. I hope everyone will actively share their ideas and experiences here to contribute to collective growth.

### Algorithm Verification and Notes

All algorithms have been verified in **MATLAB**. Most of them should work without issues. For a few that are restricted due to company-related constraints, substitute MATLAB functions written by myself are provided as alternatives. 

#### Encoding Notes
Due to MATLAB's native encoding issues (mostly ASCII), many comments in the code may appear garbled. I have spent significant time translating these comments into English to address this problem. For those preferring the original Chinese comments, it is recommended to use MATLAB's built-in editor or Notepad, ensuring the files are opened in **ASCII encoding format** (a notable limitation of MATLAB's editor).

### Development Environment

Here is the development setup I used for these algorithms:
- **MATLAB Version**: 2015b
- **Dynamics Modules**: Some sections involve SimMechanics, which requires the installation of Simscape. Note that the algorithms were initially written with the first-generation SimMechanics. Currently, SimMechanics is in its second generation, so some adjustments might be needed to make them fully compatible.

I’ll attempt to adapt the code for the second-generation SimMechanics when time permits.
