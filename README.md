# 🌟 **Robot Algorithms: Insights and Thoughts** 🤖

Welcome to this collection of robot algorithms! 🎉 Over the years, I’ve compiled these algorithms to assist **beginners** with practical guidance and provide **experienced developers** with fresh ideas for solving challenging problems. 🌱 The topics mainly revolve around **robotic arms**, covering:
- **Kinematics** 🚀
- **Dynamics** ⚙️
- **Statics** 🧲
- **Trajectory Planning** 📈  

All algorithms have been **personally tested and verified**, though there may still be edge cases or unforeseen scenarios. This collection is a **living resource**—your feedback, ideas, and contributions are highly encouraged! Let’s work together to continuously improve it. 💡

## ✨ **What’s Inside?**
🌐 This collection includes algorithms that I’ve explored, tested, and refined. Whenever I come across a promising article or algorithm, I try it out and integrate it here. Additionally:
- If you’re an expert with ideas for **new domains** (e.g., AGV algorithms), feel free to contribute! 🛠️
- Let’s **share knowledge**, **exchange experiences**, and create a vibrant community! 🎯

---

## ⚡ **Algorithm Verification**
All algorithms are tested in **MATLAB**, and most are ready to run. For a few restricted due to company policies, alternative **custom MATLAB functions** are provided.  

### 📝 Encoding Notes
MATLAB files often use **ASCII encoding**, which may cause garbled comments in non-English text. To address this:
- I’ve translated many comments into **English**.
- For those preferring **Chinese comments**, it’s best to use MATLAB’s **built-in editor** or **Notepad** in ASCII format.

## 🖥️ **Development Environment**
Here are the key details about my setup:
- **MATLAB Version**: 2015b  
- **Dynamics Modules**: Some algorithms involve SimMechanics, which requires the installation of **Simscape**. Note:
  - The algorithms were written for the **first-generation SimMechanics**.
  - Current SimMechanics is **second-generation**, so you might need to adapt the code. I plan to update this when possible.
